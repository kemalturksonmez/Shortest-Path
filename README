This program uses a geojson document stored in mongodb to build a graph of non-intersecting nodes in neo4j. Once the neo4j graph is built, the user can use it to find the shortest path between two coordinates. The program also renders an interactive map of the document and stores it in a gist. This is done twice. First to visualize the original geojson document on the map, and the second time to visualize the shortest path on the map with the geojson data. For this specific program, I used a geojson document that had a collection historical buildings in Washington D.C. The document can be found here: https://data.world/codefordc/historic-landmarks-polygons. For this program, I used the geojsonio library. However, this library contains a couple of bug. Therefore, I am currently in process of designing my own geojson visualizer that I can use alongside this program. To adapt this program to your own needs, change the city boundaries.
